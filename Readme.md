## Software Architecture hw3

​	One university intents to develop an information system for its library. The system is required to provide the functionalities such as the search and management of the information of literature (books), user management, online literature reading and so on. The users of the system are composed of teachers (lecturers), students, and administrators, with their different permissions. For example, teachers and students are eligible to borrow books from the library, but with distinct access to book categories, maximum numbers and borrowing periods. You need to develop the essential functions as below:

#### Component 1: 

Develop different borrowing methods for different user objects e.g.,teacher, undergraduate, and graduate, which are able to accommodate new (temporary)
methods or adjustments in needed.

#### Component 2: 

In the initial design, library administrators can edit literature (book)
information, maintain and manage user’s information (e.g., teachers and students),
such as generating report of borrowing records and overdue penalty payments and etc.
In the future design, more user types can be added and administrators can grant the
certain permission of user information management (e.g., creating or searching user
info) to other departments or schools.

#### Component 3: 

Design the component of online literature reading that supports
different document formats (e.g., Word, PDF, EPUB …), each of which needs a dedicated
document reader.

#### Component 4: 

Users have the permission to edit and update their personal
information, administrators can receive the automatic notification once a user’s info is
updated.
